# Objective:
# Build a basic notepad application that allows the user to create and view personal notes using Pythonâ€™s file handling modes w, a, and r.
# ---
# Instructions:
#
# Display a Menu to the User with the following choices:
# 1. Create a New Note
# 2. Append to an Existing Note
# 3. View a Note
# 4. Exit
#
# 2. If the user chooses "Create a New Note":
# Ask for the note title (use this as the filename, e.g., shopping.txt).
# Ask the user to enter multi-line content (use a loop to collect lines until the user types DONE).
# Save the content in a new file named <title>.txt.
# Use w mode to write the content (it will overwrite if file exists).
# Show a message: "Note saved successfully!"
#
#3. If the user chooses "Append to an Existing Note":
#  Ask for the existing note title (e.g., shopping.txt).
# If the file exists:
# Ask for additional content (until user types DONE).
# Use a mode to append it to the existing file.
# Show a message: "Note updated!"
#
# If the file does not exist:
# Show an error message: "Note not found!"
#
# 4. If the user chooses "View a Note":
# Ask for the note title.
# Open the corresponding file using r mode.
# Display the content of the note.
# If the file does not exist, show: "Note not found!"
#
# 5. If the user chooses "Exit", terminate the program with a goodbye message.
